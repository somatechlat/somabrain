"""Category A: Mathematical Core Proofs.

Tests that prove mathematical correctness of:
- A1: HRR Binding (spectral magnitude, unit norm, invertibility, superposition)
- A2: Vector Similarity (symmetry, self-similarity, boundedness, zero handling)
- A3: Predictor Math (Chebyshev, Lanczos, Mahalanobis, uncertainty)
- A4: Salience Computation (weighted formula, modulation, FD energy, sigmoid)

These tests have NO backend dependencies - pure mathematical verification.
