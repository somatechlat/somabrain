"""Direct health endpoint test using FastAPI's TestClient.

This test does not rely on an external uvicorn process. It imports the
application instance from ``somabrain.app`` and exercises the ``/health``
endpoint via ``TestClient``. The server logic (including configuration and
runtime singletons) is exercised inâ€‘process, providing a genuine integration
test without the need for the background ``start_test_server.sh`` script.
