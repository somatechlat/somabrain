Shared infra chart for SomaBrain

The chart now bundles production-ready manifests for the shared services that
back the Soma stack: Auth, OPA, Kafka (Bitnami), Redis (Bitnami), Etcd
(Bitnami), Vault (Hashicorp) and the kube-prometheus-stack (Prometheus +
Alertmanager). Deploy it **once per cluster** and point all application services at
the resulting in-cluster DNS names.

Quick install:
  helm dependency update infra/helm/charts/soma-infra
  helm upgrade --install soma-infra infra/helm/charts/soma-infra -n soma --create-namespace

Check status:
  kubectl get pods -n soma

Deployment notes:
- Configure `configHash` in values to force rolling updates when config changes.
- Override `values-staging.yaml` / `values-prod.yaml` for environment-specific sizing.
- All third-party components are sourced from upstream Helm repositories; run
  `helm dependency update` whenever you bump versions.

Local‑dev and strict‑mode testing
--------------------------------

Use the `localDev` toggle (see `values-dev.yaml`) to enable a slim subset of
services when iterating with kind/k3d. This avoids tearing down the production
config while still exercising the real dependencies (no stubs or mocks). Keep
`localDev` disabled in CI and production environments.

Notes:
- `configHash` is useful when you change config values and want Helm to
  perform a rolling update of deployments to pick up the change.
- Always commit updates to `values-dev.yaml`, `values-staging.yaml` and
  `values-prod.yaml` alongside code so GitOps reconciles the cluster state.
