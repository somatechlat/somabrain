## System Overview

SomaBrain is a containerized cognitive memory platform with these core components:

- **SomaBrain API**: FastAPI service exposing memory and reasoning endpoints
- **Redis**: High-performance cache for working memory and session state
- **Postgres**: Persistent storage for configuration and audit logs
- **Kafka**: Message broker for audit trails and event streaming
- **OPA**: Policy engine for authorization and governance
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and alerting

## Production Readiness

For production deployment:
1. Review [Architecture](architecture.md) to understand system design
2. Follow [Deployment](deployment.md) for installation procedures
3. Configure [Monitoring](monitoring.md) dashboards and alerts
4. Implement [Security](security/) policies
5. Train team on [Runbooks](runbooks/) procedures
