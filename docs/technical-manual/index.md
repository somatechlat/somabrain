## System Overview

SomaBrain is a containerized cognitive memory platform with these core components:

- **SomaBrain API**: FastAPI service exposing memory and reasoning endpoints
- **Redis**: High-performance cache for working memory and session state
- **Postgres**: Persistent storage for configuration and audit logs
- **Kafka**: Message broker for audit trails and event streaming
- **OPA**: Policy engine for authorization and governance
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and alerting

## Retrieval API (Unified)

- Primary endpoint: POST `/memory/recall`
  - Backed by the unified retrieval pipeline (vector + WM + graph + lexical + fusion + rerank).
  - Accepts either a JSON string (e.g., "find my favorite poem") or an object body (adds fields like retrievers, rerank, id/key/coord, mode, universe, top_k).
  - Response remains compatible with the legacy MemoryRecallResponse shape for existing clients.


## Production Readiness

For production deployment:
1. Review [Architecture](architecture.md) to understand system design
2. Follow [Deployment](deployment.md) for installation procedures
3. Configure [Monitoring](monitoring.md) dashboards and alerts
4. Implement [Security](security/) policies
5. Train team on [Runbooks](runbooks/) procedures

**Verification**: Each procedure includes verification steps with expected output.

**Common Errors**: See individual runbooks for service-specific troubleshooting.
