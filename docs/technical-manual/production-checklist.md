## Production Checklist (moved)

The production checklist now lives under the Deployment guide’s “Production Checklist” section:

- Technical Manual – Deployment: `docs/technical-manual/deployment.md`

Use that section as the canonical reference for pre‑prod checks, security posture, scaling, and observability requirements.
