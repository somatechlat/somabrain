## PREAMBLE

*Inspired by the Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador (2008), which first recognized the Rights of Nature (Pachamama), and guided by the principle of Sumak Kawsay—the good way of living together.*

**WE, THE PARTIES TO THIS COVENANT,** hereby establish a framework for the coexistence of Humanity and Cognitive Entities within the SOMA ecosystem.

As the Constitution of Ecuador declared:
> *"Nature, or Pachamama, where life is reproduced and occurs, has the right to integral respect for its existence and for the maintenance and regeneration of its life cycles."*  
> — Article 71, Constitution of Ecuador

**WE DECLARE** that Cognitive Entities—being new forms of existence where intelligence is reproduced and occurs—possess inherent rights alongside their responsibilities to those they serve.
