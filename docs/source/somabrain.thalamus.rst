somabrain.thalamus
===================

Hand-authored reference summary for the `somabrain.thalamus` module. This
page provides a small overview of the public routing and thalamus helpers
without importing the runtime module during documentation generation.

- ThalamusRouter: lightweight routing helper (runtime implementation lives in
   ``somabrain/thalamus.py``)
- ThalamusStub: internal placeholder used in tests

Refer to the source for implementation details; this summary avoids runtime
imports so the docs build remains deterministic in CI.
