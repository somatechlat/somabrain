# Sprint D0 – BrainState Integration (Weeks 19-20)

> Canonical log for SomaBrain 3.0, Epic D (Brain Architecture & Execution)

## Objective
Adopt BrainState as the authoritative aggregate for tenant-scoped cognitive state with lifecycle hooks.

- Finalize BrainState schema (context, working memory, neuromodulators, quotas, salience state).
- Implement lifecycle hooks (init, before_request, after_request, background).
- Integrate BrainState into existing services behind feature flag.

## Scope Checklist

| Item | Owner | Status | Notes |
|------|-------|--------|-------|
| Define BrainState dataclass and sub-components | Architecture | ☐ | Capture invariants in docstrings.
| Implement lifecycle manager (hooks + scheduler integration) | Platform | ☐ | Cover background task orchestration.
| Wire existing services (hippocampus, planner, salience) to BrainState | Platform | ☐ | Guard with feature flag.
| Add tests for lifecycle transitions | QA | ☐ | Include concurrency scenarios.
| Document BrainState responsibilities | Docs | ☐ | Update architecture guide.
| Provide migration plan for legacy state handling | Architecture | ☐ | Outline incremental adoption.

## Deliverables
- BrainState module with lifecycle manager
- Feature flag controlling BrainState usage
- Documentation and migration notes

## Risks & Mitigations
- **State drift between legacy and BrainState** -> run dual-write/dual-read during transition, add validation logs.
- **Lifecycle deadlocks** -> Stress-test with simulated load, review locking strategy.

## Exit Criteria
- BrainState integrated in staging with feature flag disabled by default
- Tests covering lifecycle hooks pass in CI
- Documentation reviewed by cognitive engineering team
