# Sprint D2 – Cognitive Loop Harmonization (Weeks 23-24)

> Canonical log for SomaBrain 3.0, Epic D (Brain Architecture & Execution)

## Objective
Align hippocampus, consolidation, attention, and planning flows with shared policies and BrainState data structures.

- Centralize novelty, admission, and reinforcement policies in configuration.
- Update hippocampus/consolidation to use BrainState and salience outputs.
- Document runbooks and provide monitoring for cognitive loop health.

## Scope Checklist

| Item | Owner | Status | Notes |
|------|-------|--------|-------|
| Define policy schema (novelty, admission, reinforcement) | Architecture | ☐ | Add validation + defaults.
| Refactor hippocampus/consolidation modules to use BrainState | Cognitive Eng | ☐ | Maintain behavior parity.
| Align attention and planner inputs with new salience outputs | Cognitive Eng | ☐ | Use unified scorer signals.
| Add health metrics (loop latency, failure counts) | Observability | ☐ | Dashboard panels.
| Document operational runbook | Docs | ☐ | Include troubleshooting steps.
| Run end-to-end regression tests | QA | ☐ | Cover cognitive benchmarks.

## Deliverables
- Policy configuration module with documentation
- Updated cognitive modules integrated with BrainState
- Observability dashboards and runbook for cognitive loop

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Behavior drift** -> Compare benchmark outputs pre/post change, maintain guardrails.
- **Complexity creep** -> Keep policies declarative, limit code branching.

## Exit Criteria
- Cognitive loop uses centralized policies and BrainState
- Benchmarks show parity or improvements
- Runbook approved by operations team
