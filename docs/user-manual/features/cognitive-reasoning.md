---

## Cognitive Reasoning Overview

SomaBrain extends beyond simple memory storage and retrieval to provide **cognitive reasoning capabilities** that mimic human thought processes:

### Key Capabilities

**Contextual Inference**: Draw connections between memories that aren't explicitly linked, using semantic relationships and contextual patterns.

**Multi-hop Reasoning**: Chain together multiple memories to answer complex questions that require combining information from different sources.

**Temporal Reasoning**: Understand time-based relationships, sequences, and causal connections between memories.

**Analogical Reasoning**: Find patterns and similarities across different domains to provide insights and recommendations.

**Uncertainty Handling**: Work with incomplete or conflicting information while maintaining confidence levels.

### Reasoning Architecture

```
Query → Context Analysis → Memory Retrieval → Relationship Mapping → Inference Engine → Reasoned Response
```

1. **Context Analysis**: Parse query intent and identify reasoning requirements
2. **Memory Retrieval**: Gather relevant memories using semantic similarity
3. **Relationship Mapping**: Build connections between retrieved memories
4. **Inference Engine**: Apply reasoning algorithms to derive new insights
5. **Reasoned Response**: Present conclusions with supporting evidence

---

## Contextual Inference

### Basic Contextual Queries

Ask questions that require understanding implicit relationships:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9696/reason \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: your_tenant" \
  -d '{
    "query": "What would be the best database choice for a high-traffic e-commerce application?",
    "reasoning_mode": "contextual_inference",
    "include_reasoning_path": true
  }'
```

**Example Memory Context**:
- Memory 1: "PostgreSQL supports ACID transactions critical for payment processing"
- Memory 2: "Redis provides sub-millisecond response times for session management"  
- Memory 3: "Our e-commerce site processes 10,000 orders per day"
- Memory 4: "Previous projects showed MongoDB struggled with complex transactions"

**Reasoned Response**:
```json
{
  "conclusion": "For a high-traffic e-commerce application, use PostgreSQL as the primary database for transactional data (orders, payments, inventory) with Redis as a cache layer for session management and frequently accessed product data.",
  "confidence": 0.87,
  "reasoning_path": [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "type": "requirement_analysis",
      "observation": "E-commerce requires ACID transactions for financial data integrity",
      "supporting_memories": ["mem_postgres_acid", "mem_ecommerce_requirements"]
    },
    {
      "step": 2, 
      "type": "performance_consideration",
      "observation": "High traffic demands fast read performance for product catalogs",
      "supporting_memories": ["mem_redis_performance", "mem_traffic_patterns"]
    },
    {
      "step": 3,
      "type": "risk_assessment", 
      "observation": "MongoDB transaction limitations pose risks for payment processing",
      "supporting_memories": ["mem_mongodb_limitations", "mem_payment_failures"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Verification**: The system identified implicit connections between database capabilities and e-commerce requirements without explicit relationships.

### Advanced Contextual Analysis

Perform deep contextual analysis across multiple domains:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9696/reason \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: your_tenant" \
  -d '{
    "query": "How might our team structure affect our choice of development methodology?",
    "reasoning_mode": "contextual_inference",
    "context_expansion": {
      "domains": ["team_management", "software_development", "project_history"],
      "relationship_depth": 3,
      "include_analogies": true
    }
  }'
```

**Advanced Features**:
- Cross-domain pattern recognition
- Analogical reasoning from similar situations
- Probabilistic inference with uncertainty quantification

---

## Multi-hop Reasoning

### Sequential Reasoning Chains

Answer questions requiring multiple logical steps:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9696/reason \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: your_tenant" \
  -d '{
    "query": "If we migrate from MongoDB to PostgreSQL, what infrastructure changes will we need to make?",
    "reasoning_mode": "multi_hop",
    "max_hops": 4,
    "include_intermediate_steps": true
  }'
```

**Reasoning Chain Example**:

```
Step 1: Identify current MongoDB usage patterns
├─ Memory: "MongoDB stores user profiles and session data"
├─ Memory: "Current read/write ratio is 80/20"
└─ Inference: Need to replicate these patterns in PostgreSQL

Step 2: Analyze PostgreSQL requirements  
├─ Memory: "PostgreSQL requires more RAM for optimal performance"
├─ Memory: "JSON columns can replace document structure"
└─ Inference: Infrastructure scaling needed for memory requirements

Step 3: Identify migration dependencies
├─ Memory: "Application uses MongoDB-specific aggregation pipelines"  
├─ Memory: "Several microservices depend on MongoDB change streams"
└─ Inference: Code refactoring required for PostgreSQL equivalents

Step 4: Estimate infrastructure impact
├─ Previous Steps: Memory requirements + code changes
├─ Memory: "Similar migration took 3 months for team of 4"
└─ Final Conclusion: Infrastructure + development timeline
```

**Verification**: Each reasoning step builds on previous conclusions and supporting evidence.

### Complex Decision Trees

Navigate decision trees with multiple criteria and trade-offs:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9696/reason \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: your_tenant" \
  -d '{
    "query": "Should we implement caching at the application layer, database layer, or both?",
    "reasoning_mode": "decision_tree",
    "criteria": {
      "performance": 0.4,
      "complexity": 0.3, 
      "maintainability": 0.2,
      "cost": 0.1
    },
    "include_trade_offs": true
  }'
```

**Decision Tree Output**:
```json
{
  "decision": "Implement hybrid caching: Redis for application-layer session data and PostgreSQL query caching for database layer",
  "confidence": 0.82,
  "criteria_analysis": {
    "performance": {
      "score": 0.91,
      "rationale": "Hybrid approach provides best latency for both use cases"
    },

      "score": 0.67,
      "rationale": "Moderate complexity with two caching layers to manage"
    },
    "maintainability": {
      "score": 0.75,
      "rationale": "Well-established patterns for both Redis and PostgreSQL caching"
    }
  },
  "alternatives": [
    {
      "option": "Application-layer only (Redis)",
      "overall_score": 0.73,
      "trade_offs": "Simpler but misses database query optimization"
    }
  ]
}
```
