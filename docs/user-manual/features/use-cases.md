# Use Cases and Key Features

**Purpose**: Provide real-world contexts that demonstrate how SomaBrain capabilities solve concrete problems.

**Audience**: Product owners, solution architects, and developers deciding where SomaBrain fits into their roadmap.

**Prerequisites**: Review the [Feature Index](index.md) and complete the [Quick Start Tutorial](../quick-start-tutorial.md) so you can reproduce the examples.

## High-Impact Use Cases

| Use Case | Before SomaBrain | With SomaBrain |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| **AI Chatbots** | Conversations reset every session | Conversations remember preferences, tone, and goals across time |
| **Knowledge Systems** | Keyword search misses context | Semantic recall understands intent and natural language queries |
| **AI Agents** | Agents relearn facts repeatedly | Agents build persistent expertise that evolves with users |
| **Enterprise AI** | "One-size" policies frustrate teams | Tenant isolation unlocks tailored experiences per department |
| **Research Tools** | Static PDFs limit discovery | Cognitive memory links papers, notes, and experiments automatically |

## ‚ú® Why SomaBrain Changes Everything
> *"The first AI memory system that thinks like Einstein but scales like the internet."*

### üß† Memory Systems That Never Forget
- **Multi-Tenant Working Memory**: Dedicated Redis-backed namespaces prevent cross-tenant interference.
- **Long-Term Memory Integration**: HTTP services persist strategic conversations with complete audit trails.
- **Salience Detection**: Frequency analysis highlights high-value memories automatically.
- **Memory Consolidation**: Background tasks optimise retrieval speed and relevance without manual tuning.

### ‚ö° Breakthrough Mathematics That Just Works
- **BHDC Encoding**: Binary hypervectors capture nuanced semantic relationships between concepts.
- **Permutation Binding**: Role-based binding keeps relationships ("Paris" and "France") intact during recall.
- **Quantum Layer Operations**: Superposition enables composable queries across composite ideas.
- **Deterministic Encoding**: Seeded randomness keeps test, staging, and production aligned.

### üìä Relevance That Reads Your Mind
- **Unified Similarity**: Cosine, frequency-domain, and recency scores combine for precise ranking.
- **Adaptive Weighting**: Tune component weights to prioritise recency, novelty, or semantic closeness.
- **Context Awareness**: Temporal metadata influences recall so urgent items surface ahead of stale history.
- **Density Matrix Operations**: Second-order recall uncovers indirect associations.

### üèóÔ∏è Enterprise Without Compromise
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Tenant isolation enforces data governance by design.
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-tenant quotas prevent abusive workloads from degrading shared capacity.
- **Audit Pipeline**: Event streams document every memory mutation for compliance audits.
- **Health Monitoring**: `/health` and Prometheus data expose issues before customers notice.

## Verification
- Execute one scenario end-to-end (store ‚Üí recall ‚Üí reason) using the API snippets in the linked feature guides.
- Confirm each bullet above maps to a documented feature or runbook referenced in this manual.
- Update this page when new customer case studies or benchmark wins add to SomaBrain's portfolio.

## Common Errors

| Issue | Symptom | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Over-promising capabilities | Field teams repeat outdated claims | Sync copy with the latest release notes before demos. |
| Missing prerequisites | Readers cannot reproduce scenarios | Verify Quick Start and installation steps are still accurate. |
| Stale cross-links | Clicking a scenario returns 404 | Update links whenever feature docs move or rename. |
