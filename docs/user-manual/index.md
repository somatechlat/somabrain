## üåü **Stop Building AI That Forgets Everything**

**SomaBrain gives your AI the memory it deserves.** Imagine ChatGPT that remembers your entire conversation history, recommendation engines that learn your preferences over months, or AI assistants that build relationships with users. That's the power of cognitive memory.

**What is SomaBrain?**
The world's first production-ready cognitive memory system that thinks like a human brain but operates at digital speed. Instead of dumb keyword searches, SomaBrain understands meaning, builds connections, and learns from every interaction‚Äîturning any AI application into an intelligent, learning companion.

## üöÄ **Transform Any AI Application in Minutes**

### **Before SomaBrain:**
‚ùå AI forgets everything between conversations

### **After SomaBrain:**

‚úÖ **Contextual Understanding**: Finds "Tesla Model 3" when you search for "electric car"
‚úÖ **Continuous Learning**: Adapts to user preferences and behavior patterns
‚úÖ **One-Line Setup**: `docker compose up` and you're running production-grade cognitive memory
