# Experimental: Fixed-Point Recall Mode for SomaBrain

This document records the analysis and rationale for optionally including a fixed-point recall mode in SomaBrain.

## Summary
- Fixed-point recall is mathematically elegant, simple, and proven.
- It does not disturb or replace existing math or architecture.
- It can be implemented as an optional, shadowable mode.
- All properties (convergence, stability, repeatability) are provable and auditable.
- If it does not add value, it can be removed with zero impact.

## Key Points
- **Invariant:** $\|A\|_2 < 1$ ensures unique, stable, and fast-converging recall.
- **Deterministic:** No randomness; same input always yields same output.
- **Metrics:** All relevant metrics can be exposed for external monitoring.
- **Operational Safety:** Can be shadowed, compared, and rolled back at any time.
- **Open Source Friendly:** All math and code are open and easy to document.

## Recommendation
Include as an optional, experimental mode. Evaluate in shadow mode and keep only if it delivers measurable benefits.
