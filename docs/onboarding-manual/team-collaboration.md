## Conflict Resolution

### Disagreement Types

**Technical Disagreements**:
1. **Code Implementation**: Different approaches to solving a problem
2. **Architecture Decisions**: High-level design choices
3. **Technology Choices**: Library/framework selection
4. **Performance Trade-offs**: Speed vs. maintainability decisions

**Process Disagreements**:
1. **Timeline Conflicts**: Deadline vs. quality tensions
2. **Priority Disputes**: Feature importance disagreements
3. **Resource Allocation**: Time and effort distribution
4. **Quality Standards**: Acceptable quality levels

### Resolution Process

**Level 1: Direct Discussion**
```markdown
## Steps for Direct Resolution

1. **Acknowledge**: "I see we have different views on this approach"
2. **Understand**: "Help me understand your perspective on X"
3. **Explain**: "My concern with approach Y is..."
4. **Collaborate**: "What if we tried Z as a compromise?"
5. **Document**: Record the decision and reasoning
```

**Level 2: Maintainer Mediation**
- **When**: Direct discussion doesn't reach consensus within 2 days
- **Process**: Mention maintainer in GitHub discussion
- **Timeline**: Maintainer provides decision within 48 hours
- **Authority**: Technical maintainer decision is final

**Level 3: Team Discussion**
- **When**: Significant architectural or policy decisions
- **Format**: Team meeting or async GitHub discussion
- **Participants**: All maintainers + senior contributors
- **Timeline**: One week for discussion, then formal decision

**Level 4: Project Lead Decision**
- **When**: Deadlock at team level or critical urgency
- **Authority**: Project lead (@project-lead) makes final call
- **Timeline**: 24-48 hours for critical decisions
- **Documentation**: Decision rationale published for transparency

### Best Practices

**Healthy Debate Guidelines**:
```markdown
## Effective Technical Discussions

**Do**:
✅ Focus on technical merits and trade-offs
✅ Provide concrete examples and data
✅ Consider multiple perspectives
✅ Be willing to change your mind
✅ Separate ideas from people ("the approach" not "your approach")

**Don't**:
❌ Make it personal or about individual competence
❌ Dismiss concerns without addressing them
❌ Use authority or seniority to shut down discussion
❌ Rehash previously decided issues without new information
❌ Block progress indefinitely
```

**Compromise Strategies**:
- **Timeboxed Experiments**: Try approach A for 2 weeks, then evaluate
- **Hybrid Solutions**: Combine elements from different proposals
- **Phased Implementation**: Start with simpler approach, evolve later
- **A/B Testing**: Implement both approaches and measure results

---

## Remote Work Guidelines

### Asynchronous Collaboration

**Time Zone Considerations**:
- **Core Hours**: 9 AM - 12 PM PST when most team overlap occurs
- **Meeting Scheduling**: Use shared calendar with timezone display
- **Documentation**: Always document decisions and discussions
- **Response Expectations**: 24-hour response time across timezones

**Effective Async Communication**:
```markdown
## Good Async Messages

**Provide Context**:
"I'm working on the memory search API (PR #123) and noticed that..."

**Be Specific**:
"The test on line 45 of test_memory.py is failing with error: 'AttributeError: ...'"

**Include Next Steps**:
"I'll try approach X tomorrow. If that doesn't work, should I explore Y instead?"

**Set Expectations**:
"This is blocking my progress, could someone review by EOD Thursday?"
```

### Meeting Etiquette

**Video Call Best Practices**:
- **Camera On**: Encourages engagement and connection
- **Mute When Not Speaking**: Reduces background noise
- **Good Setup**: Stable internet, clear audio, proper lighting
- **Engagement**: Active participation, avoid multitasking

**Meeting Preparation**:
```markdown
## Meeting Checklist

**Before the Meeting**:
- [ ] Review agenda and prepare talking points
- [ ] Test audio/video setup
- [ ] Have relevant documents/code ready
- [ ] Prepare questions or discussion topics

**During the Meeting**:
- [ ] Take notes on decisions and action items
- [ ] Speak up if you have concerns or questions
- [ ] Stay focused on the topic
- [ ] Respect time limits

**After the Meeting**:
- [ ] Send summary of decisions and action items
- [ ] Update GitHub issues/projects as needed
- [ ] Follow up on assigned tasks
```

### Knowledge Sharing

**Documentation Culture**:
- **Write Everything Down**: Decisions, rationale, context
- **Keep It Updated**: Documentation rots quickly without maintenance
- **Make It Searchable**: Use consistent terminology and tagging
- **Review Regularly**: Quarterly documentation audits

**Knowledge Transfer Methods**:
- **Code Comments**: Explain complex logic and decisions
- **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)**: Document significant decisions
- **Pair Programming**: Share knowledge through collaboration
- **Tech Talks**: Present interesting findings or solutions

**Verification**: Team collaboration is effective when communication is clear, conflicts are resolved constructively, and knowledge is shared efficiently.

**Common Errors**:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Messages lost in wrong channel | Use GitHub for code, Slack for quick chat |
| Timezone confusion in meetings | Always specify timezone, use UTC for clarity |
| Decisions made without documentation | Record all technical decisions in GitHub |
| Review bottlenecks | Distribute review load, set response expectations |
| Knowledge silos | Regular pair programming and documentation |
