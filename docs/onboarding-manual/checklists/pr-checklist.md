```markdown
# Example review response:

## Response to Review Comments

### @reviewer1 - Line 45: Consider using async context manager
‚úÖ **Implemented** - Changed to `async with` pattern as suggested. This ensures proper cleanup even if exceptions occur.

### @reviewer2 - Performance concern about N+1 queries  
‚úÖ **Fixed** - Added batch loading using `select_related()` to reduce database calls from O(n) to O(1).

### @reviewer3 - Add input validation
‚ùì **Question** - The validation you mentioned is already present in the BaseModel. Are you referring to additional validation beyond Pydantic? Could you clarify which specific cases you're concerned about?

### @security-team - Potential SQL injection risk
‚úÖ **Addressed** - Switched from string formatting to parameterized queries using SQLAlchemy's text() with bound parameters.

## Additional Changes Made
- Added more comprehensive tests based on feedback
- Updated documentation to clarify the new behavior
- Fixed typo in error message

Thanks everyone for the thorough review! üôè
```

## Merge Strategy

### [ ] Merge Method Selection
- [ ] **Squash and Merge**: For feature branches with multiple commits (preferred)
- [ ] **Merge Commit**: For important branches that need commit history preserved
- [ ] **Rebase and Merge**: For clean linear history when appropriate
- [ ] **Fast-forward**: Only when branch is single commit ahead

```bash
# Choose appropriate merge strategy:

# Squash and merge (most common)
git checkout main
git merge --squash feature/memory-improvements
git commit -m "feat(memory): improve search ranking algorithm

Implements enhanced ranking using multiple similarity metrics
and user feedback to improve search relevance.

Closes #123"

# Regular merge commit (for important features)
git checkout main  
git merge --no-ff feature/major-architecture-change

# Rebase and merge (for clean history)
git checkout feature/small-fix
git rebase main
git checkout main
git merge --ff-only feature/small-fix
```

### [ ] Post-Merge Actions
- [ ] **Branch Cleanup**: Delete merged feature branch
- [ ] **Issue Closure**: Verify linked issues are automatically closed
- [ ] **Deployment**: Monitor deployment pipeline if auto-deploy is enabled
- [ ] **Notifications**: Notify stakeholders of significant changes

---

## Rollback Preparedness

### [ ] Rollback Plan
- [ ] **Revert Strategy**: Plan for how to revert changes if issues arise
- [ ] **Database Migrations**: Rollback scripts for schema changes
- [ ] **Configuration Changes**: Plan for reverting configuration updates
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for monitoring change impact

### [ ] Risk Mitigation
- [ ] **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags for risky changes when possible
- [ ] **Gradual Rollout**: Plan for gradual rollout to subset of users
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Enhanced monitoring during and after deployment
- [ ] **Hotfix Process**: Clear process for emergency fixes if needed

```python
# Example: Feature flag for risky changes
from somabrain.config import feature_flags

async def search_memories(query: str, tenant_id: str) -> List[MemoryResult]:
    if feature_flags.is_enabled("enhanced_search_ranking", tenant_id):
        # New improved search algorithm
        return await enhanced_search(query, tenant_id)
    else:
        # Fallback to stable algorithm
        return await standard_search(query, tenant_id)
```

## Review Quality Standards

### [ ] Reviewer Responsibilities
- [ ] **Thorough Review**: Review all changed lines, not just major changes
- [ ] **Test the Changes**: Actually run and test the code when possible
- [ ] **Constructive Feedback**: Provide specific, actionable feedback
- [ ] **Security Focus**: Look for potential security vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Performance Impact**: Consider performance implications of changes

### [ ] Code Review Best Practices
- [ ] **Understand Context**: Read related code and documentation
- [ ] **Question Assumptions**: Ask questions when logic isn't clear
- [ ] **Suggest Improvements**: Offer specific suggestions for improvement
- [ ] **Recognize Good Work**: Acknowledge good practices and clever solutions
- [ ] **Focus on Important Issues**: Distinguish between critical issues and style preferences

```markdown
# Examples of good review comments:

## üëç Positive Feedback
"Nice use of the async context manager pattern here - this ensures proper cleanup even if an exception occurs."

## ü§î Constructive Questions  
"Could you help me understand why we're using a thread pool here instead of native async? Is there blocking I/O that I'm missing?"

## üîß Specific Suggestions
"Consider using `functools.lru_cache` here since this function is called frequently with repeated inputs:
```python
@lru_cache(maxsize=128)
def calculate_similarity_score(text1: str, text2: str) -> float:
    # existing implementation
```"

## üö® Critical Issues
"This looks like it could lead to SQL injection. Consider using parameterized queries:
```python
# Instead of: f"SELECT * FROM memories WHERE content LIKE '{query}'"
# Use: "SELECT * FROM memories WHERE content LIKE %s", (f'%{query}%',)
```"
```

**Verification**: PR checklist is complete when all items are verified and the PR is successfully merged without issues.
