"""
Reality Monitor Module for SomaBrain

This module implements reality checking and truthfulness assessment for memory
operations. It evaluates the reliability and grounding of information based on
the number of corroborating sources and provides confidence scores.

Key Features:
- Source counting for truthfulness assessment
- Confidence scoring based on evidence strength
- Configurable minimum source requirements
- Metrics collection for reality check outcomes
- Integration with memory retrieval operations

Reality Assessment:
- OK: Sufficient sources meet minimum requirements
- Low: Insufficient sources for reliable assessment
- Confidence: Normalized score based on source count vs requirements

Applications:
- Memory recall validation
- Information reliability assessment
- Confidence-based decision making
- Quality control for retrieved memories

Functions:
    assess_reality: Main reality assessment function

Classes:
    None (utility function-based implementation)
