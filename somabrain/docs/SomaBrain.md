# SomaBrain ‚Äî Revolutionary AI Architecture

SomaBrain is the **cognitive intelligence layer for the future of AI**. It transcends biological brains through elegant mathematical abstractions, delivering unprecedented performance and capabilities. Built for VS Code and FastAPI, it enables agents to think, plan, reflect, and grow beyond human limitations.

## Overview

- Modular cognition primitives layered over memory: working memory (WM), deterministic tiny embeddings, salience gating, prediction/error handling, and an executive loop.
- Runs as a FastAPI service with Prometheus observability and pluggable backends via Dynaconf/ENV.
- Memory client integrates with SomaFractalMemory HTTP API, with an offline stub fallback.

## Core Features (MVP)

### FastAPI Service
- Endpoints: `/act`, `/recall`, `/remember`, `/reflect`, `/personality`, `/health`, `/metrics`.
- Prometheus middleware for request count and latency; `/metrics` endpoint for scraping.

### Working Memory (WM)
- Lightweight in‚Äëmemory buffer with configurable capacity.
- Similarity‚Äëbased retrieval using cosine over tiny deterministic embeddings.
- Fast recall path for active context and recent items.

### Tiny Deterministic Embeddings
- 256‚Äëdimensional vectors generated with seeded RNG for reproducibility.
- Used for WM keying, novelty computation, and quick similarity without heavy models.

### Salience & Gating
- Salience = f(novelty, prediction error) with configurable weights.
- Threshold‚Äëbased gates control writes to Long‚ÄëTerm Memory (LTM) and action triggering.

### Prediction & Error (Cerebellum Stub)
- Simple predictor for step outcomes (stub initially, swappable later).
- Bounded prediction error via cosine similarity; feeds salience and learning signals.

### Executive Loop (`/act`)
For each sub‚Äëstep (Understand, Execute):
- Recall via WM and memory backend.
- Predict outcome and simulate actual outcome.
- Compute salience; write episodic memory via memory client if gated.
- Admit memory into WM for fast future recall.

### Memory Client with Stub Fallback
- Calls external SomaFractalMemory HTTP API when configured.
- Local stub implements compatible methods when API is unreachable.

### Observability
- Prometheus metrics: HTTP request count/latency; custom counters for WM hits/misses, salience decisions, prediction errors.
- HRR cleanup metrics (optional): `somabrain_hrr_cleanup_used_total`, `somabrain_hrr_cleanup_score`.
- Health endpoint reports readiness/liveness of components and configured backends.

### Configuration
- `config.yaml` + Dynaconf with `SOMABRAIN_` env var overrides.
- Tunables: WM size, salience weights/thresholds, memory backend, prediction provider, timeouts.
- HRR cleanup: enable `use_hrr` and `use_hrr_cleanup` to include cleanup signal in `/recall` and metrics.

## Revolutionary Roadmap

### üî• Phase Revolution (Immediate: Weeks 1-6) - Performance & Abstraction
- **Performance Revolution**: Break FNOM bottleneck (1.25s ‚Üí 0.2-0.3s per memory)
- **Architecture Simplification**: 80% less code, unified mathematical core
- **Emergent Intelligence**: Auto-scaling fractal cognition, pattern mining
- **Target**: 1000+ memories/second with world-changing capabilities

### Phase B (Next 2‚Äì4 weeks)
- Reflection (`/reflect`): episodic clustering + semantic summarization; reconsolidate rewritten memories.
- Consolidation & Sleep: NREM replay to strengthen semantic traces and links; REM recombination to synthesize creative semantic memories.
- Graph Reasoning: connect via memory layer's graph store; support k‚Äëhop queries and Hebbian edge updates.
- Personality Module: store/evolve preferences, expertise, and history as semantic memory; influence planning.

### Phase C (Mid‚ÄëTerm)
- LLM Integration: replace stub predictor with Ollama/OpenAI/VLLM; generate outcomes/summaries.
- Agent Zero Integration: expose SomaBrain via MCP tools; enable "think", "reflect", "personality".
- Dockerization: Dockerfile + docker‚Äëcompose (SomaBrain + Memory backend) for easy launch.

### Phase D (Advanced / Cog‚ÄëSci Inspired)
- Attention / Thalamus Layer: route sensory inputs and action gating with modulation.
- Reinforcement Signals: reward‚Äëbased gating using NE/DA‚Äëinspired parameters.
- Meta‚Äëlearning: adaptive thresholds based on performance trends.
- Predictive Memory & Error Learning: generate semantic corrections on mismatch.

## Why It Matters

- **üöÄ Elevates AI from imitation to transcendence** - Not limited by biological constraints or evolutionary compromises
- **‚ö° Performance breakthrough** - 1000+ memories/second enables real-time, world-changing applications
- **üß† Mathematical elegance** - Clean abstractions are more powerful than messy biology
- **üåç Democratizes intelligence** - Makes advanced AI accessible, understandable, and beneficial to humanity
- **üî¨ Innovation foundation** - Platform for discovering new forms of intelligence and cognition

**The result**: An AI architecture that doesn't just imitate brains - it surpasses them, creating intelligence that's faster, smarter, and more capable than biological systems.

## Implementation Notes (MVP Sketch)

- WM: ring buffer + index keyed by 256‚ÄëD vectors; cosine similarity retrieval.
- Embeddings: `numpy.RandomState(seed)` to generate stable vectors per token/chunk; cache in‚Äëprocess.
- Salience: `salience = w_novelty * (1 - cos(context, item)) + w_error * error`.
- Prediction: simple text/state similarity; later swap with provider interface (Ollama/OpenAI).
- Memory client: HTTP client to SomaFractalMemory API with timeouts; retry/backoff; JSONL audit hooks.
- Config: Dynaconf layers (file, env) with `SOMABRAIN_` prefix; minimal defaults for standalone use.

## Next Steps

- Implement FastAPI routes with WM and salience gating.
- Add memory client (HTTP + stub) and integrate into `/act` loop.
- Wire Prometheus middleware and custom metrics.
- Add smoke tests: `/act` happy path and WM recall correctness.
