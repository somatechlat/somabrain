Basal Ganglia Policy Module for SomaBrain

This module implements basal ganglia-like policy decision making for the SomaBrain system.
The basal ganglia is a key brain structure involved in action selection, motor control,
and habit formation. In SomaBrain, it serves as the final decision-making component
that translates salience signals into concrete actions.

Key Features:
- Policy decision making based on store/act gates
- Action selection and motor control simulation
- Integration with salience and neuromodulator systems
- Support for both automatic and controlled processing

The basal ganglia works in concert with the amygdala (salience detection) and
prefrontal cortex (executive control) to determine what actions to take.

Classes:
    PolicyDecision: Container for policy decisions
    BasalGangliaPolicy: Main policy decision maker
