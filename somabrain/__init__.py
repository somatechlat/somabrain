SomaBrain: Brain-Inspired Cognitive AI System
=============================================

SomaBrain is a comprehensive brain-inspired cognitive architecture for AI systems.
It implements advanced memory systems, neural processing, and cognitive functions
modeled after biological brain structures and processes.

This package provides the core functionality for:
    pass

- Multi-modal memory systems (episodic, semantic, working memory)
- Brain-inspired neural processing (thalamus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex)
- Advanced mathematical computations (quantum cognition, fractal analysis)
- Cognitive control and decision making
- Personality and neuromodulation systems
- Memory consolidation and replay
- Tool integration and action execution

The system is designed to provide human-like cognitive capabilities to AI agents,
with particular emphasis on memory, learning, and adaptive behavior.

Usage:
    pass
from somabrain import *
    # Access version information
    print(__version__)

See the documentation for detailed API usage and configuration options.
