"""
Events Module for SomaBrain.

This module provides utilities for extracting structured event information from
natural language text. It implements heuristic-based parsing to identify key
event components following the "who, did, what, where, when, why" framework.

Key Features:
- Lightweight heuristic extraction of event fields
- Support for temporal, spatial, and causal information
- Best-effort parsing with graceful degradation
- Regex-based pattern matching for common constructions

Functions:
    extract_event_fields: Extract structured event information from text.

    Extract structured event fields from natural language text.

    Performs heuristic extraction of event components using regex patterns and
    simple tokenization. Identifies optional fields: who, did, what, where, when, why.
    This is a lightweight, best-effort parser designed for simple sentences.

    Args:
        text (str): Input text to parse for event information.

    Returns:
        Dict[str, str]: Dictionary containing extracted event fields.
                        Keys may include: 'who', 'did', 'what', 'where', 'when', 'why'.
                        Empty dict if no fields can be extracted.

    Examples:
        >>> extract_event_fields("John went to Paris because he wanted adventure")
        {'who': 'John', 'did': 'went', 'what': 'Paris', 'why': 'he wanted adventure'}
        >>>
        >>> extract_event_fields("Meeting at 3:00 PM in conference room")
        {'where': 'conference', 'when': '3:00'}
        >>>
        >>> extract_event_fields("")
        {}

    Note:
        - Uses regex patterns for spatial ('at X', 'in X') and causal ('because Y') relations
        - Falls back to naive token splitting for who/did/what when patterns don't match
        - Designed for short, simple sentences; may not work well with complex text
