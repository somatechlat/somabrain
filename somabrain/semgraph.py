"""
Semantic Graph Module for SomaBrain.

This module defines the semantic graph structures and relation types used for knowledge
representation and semantic relationships in the SomaBrain system. It provides a taxonomy
of relationship types and utilities for normalizing relation specifications.

Key Features:
- Enumerated relation types for semantic relationships
- Normalization utilities for relation type strings
- Support for causal, hierarchical, and associative relations
- Extensible design for custom relation types

Classes:
    RelationType: Enumeration of semantic relation types.

Functions:
    normalize_relation: Normalize relation type strings to valid RelationType values.

    """
    Enumeration of semantic relation types for knowledge graphs.

    Defines the standard relationship types used to connect concepts and entities
    in the semantic graph. Each relation type represents a different kind of
    semantic connection between nodes.

    Values:
        related: General associative relationship
        causes: Causal relationship (A causes B)
        contrasts: Contrastive relationship (A contrasts with B)
        part_of: Meronomic relationship (A is part of B)
        depends_on: Dependency relationship (A depends on B)
        motivates: Motivational relationship (A motivates B)
        summary_of: Summarization relationship (A summarizes B)
        co_replay: Co-occurrence in memory replay

    Example:
        >>> relation = RelationType.causes
        >>> print(relation.value)  # "causes"

    Normalize a relation type string to a valid RelationType value.

    Takes a potentially invalid or None relation type string and converts it
    to a valid RelationType value. If the input is invalid or None, defaults
    to the generic "related" relation type.

    Args:
        t (str | None): Relation type string to normalize, or None.

    Returns:
        str: Normalized relation type string corresponding to a valid RelationType value.
