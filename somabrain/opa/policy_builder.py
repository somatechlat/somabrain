"""OPA policy builder utilities.

This module provides a simple function to generate an OPA Rego policy
from a constitution dictionary. At the moment the policy is static and
read from the template file ``ops/opa/policies/constitution.rego``.
Future versions may render dynamic rules based on the constitution
contents.
