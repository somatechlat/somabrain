    learning: mark tests that validate live adaptation/learning behavior

# Run only the recall‑related tests (and the direct health check) to avoid
# importing modules that depend on unavailable external services.
# Run only the recall integration test; the direct TestClient health test
# interferes with background tasks in the full app and is not required for the
# recall‑quality objective.
; Removed an overly restrictive -k filter so newly added unit tests are not
