# OPA policy template generated from the SomaBrain constitution.
# The template uses placeholders that will be replaced by the policy builder.
# Required top-level keys (e.g., version, rules) are enforced.
# Rule example: if the instance has `forbidden` set and the constitution does not allow it, deny.
